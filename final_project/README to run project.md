Start by running backend server using

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Then, to run frontend side, cd into stock_frontend.

Run the frontend using

```
npm run start
```

NOTE: If you cloned the repo and are running the project for the first time, you need to first run `npm install` and then the above command. So, in this case the code will become:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Point to be considered: This project is still in development. As of now, the backend and frontend are halfway connected. So, you can enter company's stock market code into the backend search and the graph will get updated in frontend.
